    "Why: The data is inherently time-based (hourly forecasts), making time series analysis a natural fit.\n",
    "How:\n",
    " Focus on specific variables like temperature or wind speed.\n",
    " Analyze trends and patterns within the forecast period (e.g., diurnal temperature variations).\n",
    " \n",
    " Note: True time series forecasting might be less relevant here since the API provides the forecast. However, analyzing the provided forecast data using time series techniques (like plotting trends, decomposition if you had more data) is still valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: Shows understanding of time-dependent data, though the forecasting aspect might be limited unless you collect historical data over a longer period."

    "Implement logic in analysisJson.py to parse the forecast and flag hours/days that meet these criteria.\n",
